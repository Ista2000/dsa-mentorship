### 🏷️ Who This Is For

This is for engineers who:
- Are preparing for product company interviews or remote roles
- Keep restarting DSA but never feel confident
- Don’t want to brute-force 300 LeetCode problems
- Want real structure, someone to talk to, and personal feedback

### 👨‍🏫 Who am I?

Hi, I’m Istasis Mishra.

Back in school, I was fortunate to represent India at the **International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) 2018**. During that time, I also reached [6⭐ on CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/users/ista2000) and [Candidate Master on Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/ista2000), which gave me a strong foundation in algorithmic problem solving.

I went on to pursue a **dual degree (B.Tech + M.S.) in Computer Science by Research** at the **International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Hyderabad**, and in 2023, I joined **Rubrik** as a Software Engineer, where I’ve since conducted 20+ DSA interviews as part of the hiring process.

A few years ago, I also spent a year [teaching at Unacademy](https://unacademy.com/@ista2000/batches), and over time, I’ve had the opportunity to mentor peers preparing for ICPC and Olympiads — many of whom have gone on to excel at top engineering colleges.

This mentorship is my way of bringing it all together — a place to share what I’ve learned, and to teach DSA the way I believe it should be taught: through clarity, first principles, and honest, structured practice. No grind. No fluff. Just deep understanding.

You can learn a bit more about my journey [in this interview with Coding Ninjas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f1eZ8Dfh_M) (_Pardon me, this is a very old interview 😅_).

Also, feel free to check out some of my [free sessions on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnLzvuRT69I_rEdZcVUMFkn01u9qIz1UM&si=_HlkKue9FVtz8q6w) — I hope they help!

### 💡 What This Is (and Isn’t)

This is a **small group mentorship experience**, not a mass-market bootcamp. I’ll know every student personally. I’ll track your progress, check in, and work with you on what _you_ need.

There are no pre-recorded videos. No endless dashboards. Just **live teaching, real conversations, and structured learning**.

- **Community**: Private Discord for ongoing questions, peer support, and weekly challenges

You’ll have access to recordings for all sessions — so you can revisit anytime. I will clear whatever doubts you have in our 1:1 session!

Basic programming familiarity is good enough. I’ll teach everything else from the ground up.

There’s no formal placement support, but I shall try my best to help with interview prep, mock interviews, and offer personal guidance post-bootcamp based on need and availability.

**What if I’m not selected after applying?**  
You can join the waitlist. I will open new batches based on demand and capacity.

**What tools will we use?**  
Zoom for sessions, Discord for community, Codeforces for challenges, and Notion/Docs for notes.

**How many students per batch?**  
I will take single digit number of students per batch to ensure everyone gets enough attention.

### ❤️ Final Note

If you're reading this and feeling unsure — I've been there too.

This isn’t about finishing a checklist. It’s about learning in a way that finally _sticks_. It’s not about passing one interview — it’s about knowing you'll be able to handle whatever comes your way.

If that sounds like what you need, I’d love to have you inside.

Let’s learn this properly, together.
