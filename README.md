### üë®‚Äçüè´ A Note From Me

Hi, I‚Äôm Istasis Mishra. I‚Äôve been lucky to have had some early exposure to competitive programming ‚Äî I represented India at IOI 2018 during school and spent a lot of time exploring problem-solving on platforms like CodeChef and Codeforces. Over the years, I‚Äôve also conducted DSA interviews as part of my role at Rubrik.

I spent a year teaching at Unacademy, and one of the most fulfilling parts of my journey has been helping friends and peers navigate ICPC, Olympiads, and tech interviews.

This isn‚Äôt a company, a startup, or a pre-recorded course. It‚Äôs just me, offering mentorship the way I would‚Äôve wanted it ‚Äî clear, honest, and personal.

If you‚Äôve ever felt stuck or overwhelmed while trying to learn DSA, I made this for you.

### üí° What This Is (and Isn‚Äôt)

This is a **small group mentorship experience**, not a mass-market bootcamp. I‚Äôll know every student personally. I‚Äôll track your progress, check in, and work with you on what _you_ need.

There are no pre-recorded videos. No endless dashboards. Just **live teaching, real conversations, and structured learning**.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Final Note

If you're reading this and feeling unsure ‚Äî I've been there too.

This isn‚Äôt about finishing a checklist. It‚Äôs about learning in a way that finally _sticks_. It‚Äôs not about passing one interview ‚Äî it‚Äôs about knowing you'll be able to handle whatever comes your way.

If that sounds like what you need, I‚Äôd love to have you inside.

Let‚Äôs learn this properly, together.
