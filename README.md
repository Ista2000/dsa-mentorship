### 👨‍🏫 A Note From Me

Hi, I’m Istasis Mishra. I’ve been lucky to have had some early exposure to competitive programming — I represented India at IOI 2018 during school and spent a lot of time exploring problem-solving on platforms like CodeChef and Codeforces. Over the years, I’ve also conducted DSA interviews as part of my role at Rubrik.

I spent a year teaching at Unacademy, and one of the most fulfilling parts of my journey has been helping friends and peers navigate ICPC, Olympiads, and tech interviews.

This isn’t a company, a startup, or a pre-recorded course. It’s just me, offering mentorship the way I would’ve wanted it — clear, honest, and personal.

If you’ve ever felt stuck or overwhelmed while trying to learn DSA, I made this for you.

### 💡 What This Is (and Isn’t)

This is a **small group mentorship experience**, not a mass-market bootcamp. I’ll know every student personally. I’ll track your progress, check in, and work with you on what _you_ need.

There are no pre-recorded videos. No endless dashboards. Just **live teaching, real conversations, and structured learning**.

- **Community**: Private Discord for ongoing questions, peer support, and weekly challenges

### ❓ FAQ

**What if I miss a live session?**  
You’ll have access to recordings for all sessions — so you can revisit anytime. I will clear whatever doubts you have in our 1:1 session!

**Do I need prior knowledge of DSA?**  
Basic programming familiarity is good enough. I’ll teach everything else from the ground up.

**Will I get placement support?**  
There’s no formal placement support, but I try my best to help with interview prep, mock interviews, and offer personal guidance post-bootcamp if needed.

**What if I’m not selected after applying?**  
You can join the waitlist. I open new batches based on demand and capacity.

**What tools will we use?**  
Zoom for sessions, Discord for community, Codeforces for challenges, and Notion/Docs for notes.

**How many students per batch?**  
I usually take single digit number of students per batch to ensure everyone gets enough attention.

### ❤️ Final Note

If you're reading this and feeling unsure — I've been there too.

This isn’t about finishing a checklist. It’s about learning in a way that finally _sticks_. It’s not about passing one interview — it’s about knowing you'll be able to handle whatever comes your way.

If that sounds like what you need, I’d love to have you inside.

Let’s learn this properly, together.
