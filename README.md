### 🏷️ Who This Is For

This is for engineers who:
- Are preparing for product company interviews or remote roles
- Keep restarting DSA but never feel confident
- Don’t want to brute-force 300 LeetCode problems
- Want real structure, someone to talk to, and personal feedback

### 👨‍🏫 Who am I?

Hi, I’m Istasis Mishra. I was fortunate to be part of the Indian team at IOI 2018, and during school I reached 6⭐ on CodeChef and Candidate Master on Codeforces. Later on, I joined Rubrik as a Software Engineer in 2023 and have now conducted over 20 DSA interviews as part of the hiring process.

A few years ago, I spent a year teaching at Unacademy, and have also helped peers prepare for ICPC and Olympiads — some of whom went on to great engineering colleges.

This bootcamp is simply my way of bringing together everything I’ve learned — a space to go deep into DSA, with a focus on first principles over memorization. No grind. No fluff. Just honest understanding.

### 💡 What This Is (and Isn’t)

This is a **small group mentorship experience**, not a mass-market bootcamp. I’ll know every student personally. I’ll track your progress, check in, and work with you on what _you_ need.

There are no pre-recorded videos. No endless dashboards. Just **live teaching, real conversations, and structured learning**.

### 📅 Format & Flow

- **Duration**: 4 weeks
- **Sessions**: 2/week (90 mins each, live on Zoom with handwritten walkthroughs)
- **Community**: Private Discord for ongoing questions, peer support, and weekly challenges
- **Office Hours**: 1:1s available to discuss anything you're stuck on
- **Access**: Session notes and recordings available

### ❓ FAQ

**What if I miss a live session?**  
You’ll have access to recordings for all sessions — so you can revisit anytime. I will clear whatever doubts you have in our 1:1 session!

**Do I need prior knowledge of DSA?**  
Basic programming familiarity is good enough. I’ll teach everything else from the ground up.

**Will I get placement support?**  
There’s no formal placement support, but I try my best to help with interview prep, mock interviews, and offer personal guidance post-bootcamp if needed.

**What if I’m not selected after applying?**  
You can join the waitlist. I open new batches based on demand and capacity.

**What tools will we use?**  
Zoom for sessions, Discord for community, Codeforces for challenges, and Notion/Docs for notes.

**How many students per batch?**  
I usually take single digit number of students per batch to ensure everyone gets enough attention.

### ❤️ Final Note

If you're reading this and feeling unsure — I've been there too.

This isn’t about finishing a checklist. It’s about learning in a way that finally _sticks_. It’s not about passing one interview — it’s about knowing you'll be able to handle whatever comes your way.

If that sounds like what you need, I’d love to have you inside.

Let’s learn this properly, together.
